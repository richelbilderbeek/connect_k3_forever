# Connect K3 Forever

## History

In 2007, the first version of this game was called 'K3-Op-Een-Rij' (literally: 'K3 on a row')
honoring the Dutch connection of the band.

The [first versions](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/K3OpEenRijVcl)
were programming in C++ Builder and used the Borland's VCL library,
due to which the game could only be played on Windows.

Around 2015, the game was rewritten and
[those later versions](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/K3OpEenRij)
using Qt Creator using the Qt library, due to which the game
became platform independent.
