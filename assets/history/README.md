# History

In 2007, the first version of this game was called 'K3-Op-Een-Rij' (literally: 'K3 on a row')
honoring the Dutch connection of the band.

## Versions 0.1 to 4.0: VCL

The [first versions](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/K3OpEenRijVcl)
were programming in C++ Builder and used the Borland's VCL library,
due to which the game could only be played on Windows.

### Version 3.0

This was the first complete implementation of the game.

## Versions 5.0 to 9.2: Qt and Wt

Around 2015, the game was rewritten and
[those later versions](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/K3OpEenRij)
using Qt Creator using the Qt library, due to which the game
became platform independent. Additionally,
a version was added to run in the internet browser,
that uses the Wt libaries.

### Versions 5.0 and 5.1

These version were the first Qt and Wt implementations.

first name).
